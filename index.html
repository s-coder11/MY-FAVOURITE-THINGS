        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Cricket is my favorite hobby and a famous sport too. It makes me feel healthy, fit and a stronger person. It makes me feel confident and proud of what I am. I started playing cricket when I was a kid of 7 years old.

            My cricket passion started when I was a small kid and I started playing this game with my elder brother in the back side of my home.
            <br><br>
            At that time also I was a good player in comparison to the children of my age. May be because I love to play cricket and I play it too seriously focusing on each and every ball.
