        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Cricket is my favorite hobby and a famous sport too. It makes me feel healthy, fit and a stronger person. It makes me feel confident and proud of what I am. I started playing cricket when I was a kid of 7 years old.

            My cricket passion started when I was a small kid and I started playing this game with my elder brother in the back side of my home.
            <br><br>
            At that time also I was a good player in comparison to the children of my age. May be because I love to play cricket and I play it too seriously focusing on each and every ball.

        <p>I like many cricketers but my favourite cricketer is Rohit Sharma. Rohit Sharma is an Indian cricket player. Rohit is also the captain of IPL team Mumbai Indians. Sharma currently holds the record for highest individual score in One Day Internationals. He scored a record 264 off 173 balls against Srilanka on November 13, 2014. Rohit is also the only player to score two double centuries in One Day Internationals. He is also the only person to score 250+ in ODI innings.
